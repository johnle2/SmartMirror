This is the source code used for the SMART MIRROR project

1. Before running the draw_bmp.py, make sure of the following
	a. The device has bluetooth
	b. Run rfcomm bind rfcomm0 <MAC address of bluetooth chip used)
	c. compile the picsend.c with 
		gcc -o main picsend.chip
	d. run the program as root

2. This will allow the program to start and UI will be generated, as the picture will be sent to the LCD screen on the mirror.

3. font_rom.h is used by ECE385 course, all credits to them
4. ssd1963.h and ssd1963.c is the library for interfacing the LCD at a low level, while main.c contains high level interfacing, such as draw text/ string and read picture from UART port
